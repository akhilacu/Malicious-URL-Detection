# Malicious-URL-Detection
Malicious URLs or malicious website is a very serious threat to cybersecurity. Malicious URLs host unsolicited content (spam, phishing, drive-by downloads, etc.) and lure unsuspecting users to become victims of scams (monetary loss, theft of private information, and malware installation), and cause losses of billions of dollars every year.
For training and testing machine learning algorithms, we have used a huge dataset of 651,191 URLs, out of which 428103 benign or safe URLs, 96457 defacement URLs, 94111 phishing URLs, and 32520 malware URLs. Figure 2 depicts their distribution in terms of percentage. As we know one of the most crucial tasks is to curate the dataset for a machine learning project. We have curated this dataset from five different sources.

For collecting benign, phishing, malware and defacement URLs we have used URL dataset (ISCX-URL-2016) For increasing phishing and malware URLs, we have used Malware domain black list dataset. We have increased benign URLs using faizan git repo At last, we have increased more number of phishing URLs using Phishtank dataset and PhishStorm dataset As we have told you that dataset is collected from different sources. So firstly, we have collected the URLs from different sources into separate dataframe and finally merge them to retain only URLs and their class type.
